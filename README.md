# Secure Architectures

## I. Security, Identity, and Compliance

### 1. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) ![IAM](icon/Resource-Icons_07312022/Res_Security-Identity-and-Compliance/Res_48_Light/Res_AWS-Identity-Access-Management_AWS-STS_48_Light.png)

![iam-how-it-works](icon/Secure/iam-how-it-works-diagram.04a2c4e4a1e8848155840676fa97ff2146d19012.png)

#### Features

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Global service (regardless regions)
- First IAM users has no any permission.
- Can attach multiple policy for user.

#### Use cases

- Apply fine-grained permissions and scale with attribute-based access control
- Manage per-account access or scale access across AWS accounts and applications
- Establish organization-wide and preventative guardrails on AWS
- Set, verify, and right-size permissions toward least privilege

#### AWS root user

- First created user
- Highest permission
- Root account credentials

#### Components

- **User**

  - who can access AWS resources by using **username-password** or (**access key** and **secret key**)
  - be created by root user

- **Access key**
  - string is **20** characters long.
- **Secret key**
  - string is **40** characters long.

=> Access key and Secret key were used to initial API, SDK and authenticate CLI.

- **Password policy**
  - Definition of rules to validate password such as length, complexity, e.g . period
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
  - Secure account
  - **6** characters
  - For Root user
- **Group**
  - 1 collection of IAM users
- **Role**
  - Manage IAM which can access AWS resources
- **Policy**
  - JSON
  - Always go with Group, Roles, User

#### AWS CLI

- Command line interface that help access to AWS service.

### 2. AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)

![iam-how-it-works](icon/Secure/AWS-KMS.png)

- Create multi-Region keys

#### KMS - Customer Master Key ã€€(CMK) Types

- _Symmetric_ (AES - 256 keys)
  - Single encryption ( en & de)
- _Asymmetric_ (RSA & ECC key pairs)
  - Public and Private key pairs
  - En & De or Sign/Verify
  - Private key can be download, but private key need to keep carefully.

#### KMS Automatic Key Rotation

- Used for Customer-managed CMK
- After a period time, key will be expire, need to require renewal key
- Annual or manually renewal after 90 days, 180 days

### 3. AWS CloudHSM (Cloud Hardware Security Module)
